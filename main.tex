\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\section{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}
\paragraph{Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an expansive field that integrates principles from computer science, mathematics, and neuroscience to set up systems capable of simulating human cognitive functions and executing tasks traditionally requiring human intellect \cite{russell2010artificial}. 
This interdisciplinary approach transforms AI from a mere conceptual framework into an indispensable tool across diverse sectors such as technology, finance, and entertainment. 
The core of AI's functionality is its ability to learn from data and make decisions autonomously, without hard coding the explicit instructions. 
One of the foundational models in AI's evolution is machine learning \cite{jordan2015machine}, which includes techniques for classification, regression, and clustering \cite{huang2022large}. 
These methods allow computers to learn patterns and make predictions from data, forming the basis for many early AI applications. 
As the field matured, researchers developed more sophisticated models, including neural networks \cite{abiodun2018state}, which imitate the structure and function of the human brain to perform complex pattern recognition tasks \cite{schmidhuber2015deep}.
}
\paragraph{The evolution of AI is marked by significant milestones, particularly with the advent of deep learning \cite{lecun2015deep} techniques, which have revolutionized areas like computer vision \cite{voulodimos2018deep} and natural language processing (NLP) \cite{chowdhary2020natural}. 
Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, employs complex neural networks with multiple layers of processing units, enabling the extraction of high-level features from raw input data. 
It improved the performance of AI systems in tasks ranging from image and speech recognition to language translation \cite{goodfellow2016deep}.
Recent years some specialized architectures have further pushed the boundaries of what AI can achieve. 
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), \cite{rezende2014stochastic, kingma2013auto}, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), \cite{goodfellow2014generative, vondrick2016generating, tulyakov2018mocogan, clark2019adversarial, brooks2022generating}, and diffusion models \cite{rombach2022high, ho2022imagen, blattmann2023align, gupta2023photorealistic} represent the forefront of AI research in data generation. 
GANs consist of two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—competing against each other to generate new, synthetic instances of data that are indistinguishable from real data. 
This has proven especially powerful in the fields of vision and sound generation, enabling the creation of photorealistic images, videos, and lifelike synthetic audio \cite{granot2022drop}.
}

\paragraph{The advancements in AI have not only expanded the horizons of what is technically feasible but have also paved the way for innovations in digital content creation that were previously unimaginable. 
The development and application of StyleGAN \cite{karras2019style} and its successors have been pivotal in pushing the limits of image generation technologies. 
These models have the remarkable ability to produce images of astonishing realism, manipulate facial expressions with precision, and even venture into the realm of digital art creation \cite{patashnik2021styleclip}. 
Similarly, the advent of diffusion models marks a significant leap in the quality of generated content, setting unprecedented standards for both image and sound generation \cite{rombach2022high}. 
These models operate by iteratively refining data inputs through a process that progressively reduces noise, allowing for the creation of outputs that are not only highly detailed but also deeply resonant with the nuances of real-world sensory experiences. 
Such advancements underscore the multifaceted impact of AI in the digital domain, where the synergy between complex neural networks and deep learning techniques is not just enhancing the visual and auditory quality of synthetic media but is also broadening the scope of creative expression and immersion in virtual environments. 
This ongoing evolution in AI-driven content generation reflects a convergence of insights from across computer science, mathematics, and neuroscience, highlighting the interdisciplinary effort that underpins AI's capability to reinterpret and reimagine the way machines understand and interact with the world around us \cite{silver2016mastering}.}

\section{Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)}

\paragraph{In the field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), platforms like ChatGPT \cite{leiter2023chatgpt} \cite{openai2023gpt}, MidJourney \cite{MidjourneyExplore}, Runway \cite{runwayml}, and ElevenLabs \cite{elevenlabs} are redefining the boundaries of creative expression. 
ChatGPT, with its sophisticated large language model, excels in generating text that mocks human-like understanding and creativity, making it a helpful tool for crafting compelling narratives, dialogues, and even complex literary works. 
Its ability to process and produce coherent, contextually relevant content on a vast array of topics has democratized content creation, enabling writers and creators to generate high-quality text-based content efficiently. 
Similarly, MidJourney revolutionizes the visual aspect of content creation by transforming textual descriptions into detailed, high-resolution images, and also style transformation.
This AI-driven approach to art and design allows creators to visualize abstract concepts and bring their most imaginative ideas to life, significantly simplifying the visual image storytelling process. 
Runway offers a toolkit of video generation and editing powered by AI, enabling creators to automate labor-intensive tasks such as object detection, background removal, and even generating video clips from textual prompts. 
This not only streamlines the video production process but also opens up new avenues for creativity and experimentation in visual content. 
ElevenLabs, with its state-of-the-art voice synthesis technology, provides solutions for text to speech and speech to text, changing the language of a speech, and even cloning the voice.
Whether for dubbing, voiceovers, or virtual assistants, ElevenLabs offers unparalleled customization, allowing for the creation of unique vocal identities that can speak in multiple languages and tones. 
The combination of these AI models—ChatGPT, MidJourney, Runway, and ElevenLabs prelude a new age in digital content creation, where the fusion of text, image, video, and voice generated through AI not only enriches the content landscape but also offers creators the tools to craft experiences that were once unimaginable.

\section{AIGC in Image and Video}

\subsection{Variational Autoencoders (VAE)}

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a subclass of autoencoders that are foundational for generative models. They are composed of an encoder and a decoder \cite{cho2014properties}. The encoder transforms input data into a latent space, whereas the decoder reconstructs the input data from this space. The latent space is typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution, with the encoder providing the parameters—mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$—for this distribution.

The encoder part of a VAE is responsible for compressing the input data into a latent representation. For a given data element $x_i$, the encoder produces a mean $\mu_i$ and a variance $\sigma^2_i$ that define a Gaussian distribution in the latent space. The encoding process can be represented by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\log q_{\phi} \left( z^{(i)} | x^{(i)} \right) = \log \mathcal{N} \left( z^{(i)}; \mu^{(i)}, \sigma^{2(i)} I \right).
\end{equation}

To allow for gradient descent methods to work, VAEs employ a reparameterization trick. This trick involves sampling a noise vector $\epsilon$ from a standard Gaussian distribution and then constructing the latent vector $z_i$ by scaling the noise with the standard deviation and shifting by the mean:
\begin{equation}
z_i = \mu_i + \epsilon \times \sigma_i,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.

The decoder's goal is to reconstruct the input data from the latent representation. It tries to generate data that is as close as possible to the original input by maximizing the likelihood of the data given the latent space representation.

The training of VAEs involves maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the marginal likelihood of the observed data. The ELBO can be represented as follows:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_b = -D_{KL}(q(z|x)||p(z)) + \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L}(\log P(x|z)).
\end{equation}
Furthermore, the ELBO can be decomposed into two terms: the first being the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the encoder's distribution and the prior distribution of the latent variables, and the second term being the expected log-likelihood of the data given the latent variables. For a latent space with dimensionality $d$, and assuming a standard Gaussian prior, the loss function simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\theta, x^i) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d} \left( \mu^{2}_{(i)} + \sigma^{2}_{(i)} - \log \sigma^{2}_{(i)} - 1 \right) + \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \left( \log P(x^{i} | z) \right).
\end{equation}

Despite their advantages for generative tasks, VAEs have limitations, particularly for image generation. Directly sampling from the Gaussian distribution often results in blurred images. Moreover, there is an information loss when projecting the data to a lower-dimensional latent space, which affects the quality of the reconstruction. However, VAEs find extensive applications in feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, and they can be particularly effective when combined with other generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or diffusion models.

\subsection{Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)}

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represent a class of generative models that has significantly impacted the field of synthetic image generation. A GAN is composed of two distinct neural network models: a \textit{generator} ($G$) and a \textit{discriminator} ($D$). The generator attempts to produce data that is indistinguishable from genuine data, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the data, distinguishing between actual and generated samples.

The objective function of a GAN is formulated as a min-max game between $G$ and $D$:
\begin{align}
\min_{G} \max_{D} V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_{z}(z)}[\log (1 - D(G(z)))],
\end{align}
where $p_{data}$ is the data distribution, $x$ represents real data, $z$ is a noise sample from distribution $p_z$, and $G(z)$ is the generated data.

During training, $D$ is optimized to maximize the probability of correctly classifying a sample as real or fake. Simultaneously, $G$ is optimized to minimize $\log(1 - D(G(z)))$. In practice, this is often achieved by alternating between the following gradient ascent step for $D$:
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\theta_d} \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \Big[ \log D(x^{(i)}) + \log (1 - D(G(z^{(i)}))) \Big],
\end{align}
and the gradient descent step for $G$:
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\theta_g} \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log (1 - D(G(z^{(i)}))),
\end{align}
for a minibatch of $m$ samples.

GANs have been utilized to generate high-fidelity images, outperforming other generative models in visual quality. However, they often struggle with mode collapse -- a phenomenon where the generator produces a limited variety of outputs. Despite these challenges, GANs have shown impressive results in tasks beyond image generation, such as image super-resolution \cite{denton2015deep}and object detection \cite{goodfellow2014generative}.

\subsection{Diffusion Models}

Diffusion models \cite{sohl2015deep, ho2020denoising} are a class of generative models famous for their ability to generate high-quality images through a process that iteratively adds and removes noise. These models are characterized by their use of a Markov chain to gradually convert simple noise distributions into complex data distributions.

A diffusion model typically consists of two main components: the forward process (described in Algorithm 1) and the reverse process (described in Algorithm 2). The forward process models the gradual addition of noise to the data, while the reverse process models the generation of data from noise. Mathematically, the forward process can be described by:
\begin{equation}
q(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} \mathbf{x}_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I}),
\end{equation}
where $\beta_t$ is a variance schedule over discrete timesteps $t = 1, 2, ..., T$. 

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Diffusion model training \cite{bie2023renaissance}}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE for every training iteration do
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Sample $t$ from discrete timestep $1, 2, \ldots, T$, or from continuous timestep $t \sim [0, 1]$.
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Sample random noise $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Calculate $x_t$ based on DDPM forward or SDE forward.
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Update the model with noise prediction $\epsilon(x_t, t)$ or score function $s(x_t, t)$.
\STATE end for
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:diffusion_model_training}
\end{algorithm}

The reverse process involves learning a model to reverse this noise addition:
\begin{equation}
p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \mu_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \Sigma_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_t, t)),
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_t, t)$ and $\Sigma_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_t, t)$ are functions parameterized by a neural network.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Diffusion model Inference \cite{bie2023renaissance}}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Sample $x_t$ from normal Gaussian distribution $x_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$.
\STATE Sample discrete timesteps from $1, 2, \ldots, T$ or continuous timestep from $[0,1]$.
\STATE for $t$ in Reverse(timesteps) do
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Calculate the noise distribution $\epsilon(x_t, t)$ or score function $s(x_t, t)$ with the corresponding diffusion model.
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Approximate $x_{t-1}$ or $x_{t-\Delta t}$ based on the reverse function.
\STATE end for
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:diffusion_model_inference}
\end{algorithm}

The training of diffusion models, as outlined in Algorithm 1, involves adjusting the parameters of the neural network to maximize the likelihood of the data under the reverse process. Similarly, the inference procedure, as outlined in Algorithm 2, utilizes the trained model to generate new data samples by reversing the noise process.

Diffusion models have been applied to a variety of tasks beyond image generation, such as super-resolution and inpainting, demonstrating their versatility and potential in numerous domains of generative modeling.


\subsection{Mitigating Biases in Generative Systems}

\paragraph{The development of generative text-to-image models has brought forth the challenge of mitigating social biases that these models may perpetuate. 
Notably, biases towards certain genders or skin tones have been observed in the outcomes of these image generation models. 
To offset this, a novel approach has been proposed \cite{esposito2023mitigating}, which involves fine-tuning text-to-image models on synthetic data constructed from diverse text prompts. 
These prompts include a variety of perceived skin tones, genders, ethnicities, professions, and age groups, resulting in a more inclusive synthetic dataset. 
Fine-tuning models with this diverse data has shown to substantially improve group fairness metrics, reducing biases by significant margins.
The process begins with the construction of text prompts through multiplicative combinations of various social qualifiers, which are then used to synthesize images that showcase a broad spectrum of human diversity. 
This method has proven to be effective, with diversity-finetuned models not only generating content that is more representative of darker skin tones and female genders but also improving overall fairness in model outcomes.}

\paragraph{Furthermore, the evaluation of biases in text-to-image models is formulated within a group fairness framework, which assesses whether model outputs unfairly favor certain subgroups over others. 
By adopting this framework, the research moves beyond merely measuring bias to actively promoting fairness in AI-generated content. 
This is complemented by user studies that validate the absence of undesirable visual artifacts in finetuned models' outputs.
This approach not only showcases the capability to generate more inclusive content but also highlights the potential for AI to serve as a tool for social change. 
By actively mitigating biases, AI models can foster digital environments that are reflective of a wide spectrum of human experiences and perspectives, thereby promoting inclusivity and diversity.
Future work need to address additional forms of biases and explore the applicability of mitigative strategies in video models, thereby extending the principles of fairness and inclusivity to broader multimedia contexts.
}

\subsection{Ethical Considerations: Deepfakes and Copyright}

\paragraph{The advancement of deepfake \cite{westerlund2019emergence} technology has sparked ethical debates concerning the creation and use of AI-generated content. 
Deepfakes, which involve altering videos and images to the point of being indistinguishable from authentic media, have the potential to distort reality and spread misinformation. 
The manipulation of media content raises concerns about the impact on individuals' reputations and the broader implications for societal and political discourse. 
As artificial intelligence capabilities grow, the need for ethical guidelines that ensure transparency and prevent biases becomes more urgent.
Coupled with the ethical concerns surrounding deepfakes is the issue of copyright in AI-generated images and videos. \cite{hristov2016artificial}
The legal system is currently unprepared to tackle questions of ownership and violation when content is created by an AI. 
This prompts a discussion about the originality of AI-generated works and the ethical use of AI in creative processes. 
As AI becomes more pervasive, it will challenge traditional copyright laws, necessitating continuous research and the development of legal measures that keep pace with AI advancements.}


\subsection{Computational Efficiency and Resolution Enhancement in Visual Processing}

\paragraph{In the rapidly evolving domain of image and video processing, advancements such as Skip-Convolutions \cite{habibian2021skip} have significantly bolstered computational efficiency, enabling high-quality visual outputs without compromising on speed or fidelity. 
These innovative methods bypass traditional linear processing pathways, allowing for selective data transmission across layers, thereby reducing the computational load while preserving or even enhancing the quality of video content. 
This technique proves especially beneficial for tasks that demand real-time processing, including live streaming, augmented reality (AR) applications, and instant video communication platforms, by accelerating video editing and enhancement operations. 
Furthermore, enhancing the resolution of images and videos has become increasingly crucial, with technologies like AI-based upscaling playing a pivotal role. 
AI upscaling techniques intelligently increase the resolution of digital media, ensuring that even content produced at lower resolutions can meet the current standards expected by consumers, without the need for extensive computational resources. 
By integrating such approaches, Skip-Convolutions, along with AI upscaling, address the growing demand for premium video content that can be swiftly produced, edited, and shared, marking a significant shift towards more agile and efficient content creation paradigms. 
Consequently, these advancements not only elevate the technical capabilities of video processing software but also substantially contribute to the broader field of digital media, where speed, efficiency, and enhanced resolution are of utmost importance. 
This progress highlights the ongoing necessity for innovation in computational methodologies to navigate the challenges presented by the increasing demand for sophisticated video content across various digital platforms.}



\section{AIGC in Sound}

\subsection{Music Composition and Production}
\paragraph{Artificial Intelligence (AI), leveraging deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) \cite{srivastava2015unsupervised} \cite{chiappa2017recurrent} \cite{ha2018world} and Autoregressive Transformers \cite{yan2021videogpt} \cite{wu2022nuwa}, has significantly advanced the field of music composition, transcending traditional genre boundaries to encompass everything from classical to contemporary pop. These AI algorithms sift through extensive datasets of music, absorbing and analyzing compositional patterns, structures, and styles inherent within. Through this comprehensive learning process, they acquire the capability to generate novel musical compositions that bear a striking resemblance to those created by human composers, both in complexity and emotional depth. This remarkable proficiency not only equips artists and producers with sophisticated tools to venture into uncharted creative territories but also democratizes the process of music production. By mitigating the barrier posed by the lack of formal musical training, AI-powered music composition becomes an invaluable resource, offering a platform for a broader demographic to express their creativity through music. The technology's ability to replicate the nuances of human composition highlights a significant leap in AI's role in creative arts, bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and human emotional expression. Consequently, this development not only enriches the musical landscape with diverse and innovative compositions but also catalyzes a shift in the dynamics of music creation and consumption, making the art of music composition more inclusive and accessible to a global audience \cite{briot2021artificial}. This transformative use of AI in music composition exemplifies the broader potential of AI to influence and enhance creative industries, heralding a new era of artistic expression that melds human creativity with computational precision and versatility.}

\subsection{Voice Synthesis and Modification}
\paragraph{The domain of voice synthesis has witnessed profound advancements through the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with the introduction of technologies like WaveNet and Tacotron, which have significantly narrowed the gap between synthetic and human speech. These AI-driven systems excel in capturing the nuances of human tonality, inflection, and emotion, producing synthetic voices of unparalleled realism. The intricacies of speech, including the subtle variations in pitch, pace, and volume that convey different emotions and intentions, are now accurately replicated by these models, enabling a wide array of applications. From powering virtual assistants with voices that can express empathy and understanding to creating audiobooks narrated with engaging and dynamic inflections, and even providing voiceovers for animations that require a diverse range of character voices, AI has expanded the horizons of voice synthesis. Furthermore, the ability to tailor these synthetic voices with specific emotional tones or accents has not only enhanced the user experience by making interactions more natural and engaging but also significantly broadened the potential for innovation in interactive media and communication. This capability to customize and generate human-like speech through AI not only demonstrates the technological achievements in the field but also highlights the potential for creating more immersive and emotionally resonant digital environments. As these technologies continue to evolve, they promise to further transform our interaction with machines, making digital communication more natural and intuitive than ever before \cite{oord2016wavenet}.}
\subsection{Sound Effects Generation}
\paragraph{Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed the landscape of sound effects generation, offering unparalleled versatility and creativity in audio design. Through the utilization of advanced machine learning techniques, AI models are trained on extensive libraries of pre-recorded sound effects, enabling them to learn and replicate the acoustic characteristics of a wide range of environments and actions. This innovative approach allows for the synthesis of highly realistic and novel sounds, from the delicate rustling of leaves to the complex cacophony of urban environments. The application of AI in this field is particularly beneficial in enhancing the realism and immersive quality of multimedia experiences, such as video games, films, and virtual reality simulations. By generating sound effects that are tailored to the specific requirements of a scene or action, AI reduces the dependence on traditional, extensive sound libraries, facilitating the creation of unique and context-specific audio landscapes. This capability not only streamlines the audio process but also opens up new possibilities for creative expression in sound design, enabling creators to craft more engaging and authentic auditory experiences. The advent of AI-driven sound effects generation marks a pivotal development in the field of audio engineering, promising to further elevate the sensory richness of digital and interactive media \cite{greshler2021catch}.}
\subsection{Enhancing Audio Quality}
\paragraph{The enhancement of audio quality through Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a significant leap forward in the field of sound engineering, addressing some of the most persistent challenges in audio processing with innovative solutions. Advanced AI algorithms are at the forefront of this revolution, employing sophisticated techniques such as noise reduction, sound separation, and audio restoration to significantly improve the clarity and fidelity of sound recordings. These algorithms excel at isolating vocal tracks from noisy backgrounds, enabling clear communication in environments previously deemed unsuitable for high-quality audio capture. Furthermore, they can deftly separate individual musical instruments within a complex mix, offering producers unprecedented control over the editing and mixing process. Perhaps most remarkably, AI-driven techniques breathe new life into old recordings, restoring them to their former glory by removing artifacts and distortions that have long obscured their original quality. This multifaceted approach to audio enhancement not only benefits content creators, providing them with cleaner, more manipulable audio tracks, but also significantly elevates the listening experience for consumers, ensuring access to high-quality audio regardless of the source material's age or condition. The integration of AI in enhancing audio quality thus stands as a testament to the transformative potential of these technologies, offering a glimpse into a future where pristine sound is universally accessible, transcending the limitations of traditional audio processing methods \cite{valentini2018speech}.}

\section{Current Development Trends}

\paragraph{The current landscape of AI-driven advancements in image, video, and now sound generation is witnessing unprecedented growth, characterized by both the deepening sophistication of technologies and the broadening scope of applications. In the realm of image and video generation, the pursuit of high-fidelity and high-resolution synthesis has led to the development of models like Latent Diffusion Models, which excel in generating images with remarkable detail and clarity \cite{rombach2022high}. The exploration of AI's capabilities has expanded into 3D space, with Neural Cellular Automata models facilitating the creation of complex three-dimensional objects and functional machines, marking a significant leap from traditional 2D image manipulation \cite{sudhakaran2021growing}. Efforts to enhance real-time processing and efficiency have brought about innovations such as Skip-Convolutions, optimizing video processing tasks to achieve faster outputs without compromising quality \cite{habibian2021skip}.}
