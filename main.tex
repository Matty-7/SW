These methods allow computers to learn patterns and make predictions from data, forming the basis for many early AI applications. 
As the field matured, researchers developed more sophisticated models, including neural networks \cite{abiodun2018state}, which imitate the structure and function of the human brain to perform complex pattern recognition tasks \cite{schmidhuber2015deep}.
}
\paragraph{The evolution of AI is marked by significant milestones, particularly with the advent of deep learning \cite{lecun2015deep} techniques, which have revolutionized areas like computer vision \cite{voulodimos2018deep} and natural language processing (NLP) \cite{chowdhary2020natural}. 
Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, employs complex neural networks with multiple layers of processing units, enabling the extraction of high-level features from raw input data. 
It improved the performance of AI systems in tasks ranging from image and speech recognition to language translation \cite{goodfellow2016deep}.
Recent years some specialized architectures have further pushed the boundaries of what AI can achieve. 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), \cite{goodfellow2014generative} \cite{vondrick2016generating} \cite{tulyakov2018mocogan} \cite{clark2019adversarial} \cite{brooks2022generating}, and diffusion models \cite{rombach2022high} \cite{ho2022imagen} \cite{blattmann2023align} \cite{gupta2023photorealistic} represent the forefront of AI research in data generation. 
GANs consist of two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—competing against each other to generate new, synthetic instances of data that are indistinguishable from real data. 
This has proven especially powerful in the fields of vision and sound generation, enabling the creation of photorealistic images, videos, and lifelike synthetic audio \cite{granot2022drop}.
}

\paragraph{In the domain of digital content creation, these advancements have ushered in a new era of possibilities.
