\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\section{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an expansive field that integrates principles from computer science, mathematics, and neuroscience to set up systems capable of simulating human cognitive functions and executing tasks traditionally requiring human intellect \cite{russell2010artificial}. 
This interdisciplinary approach transforms AI from a mere conceptual framework into an indispensable tool across diverse sectors such as technology, finance, and entertainment. 
The core of AI's functionality is its ability to learn from data and make decisions autonomously, without hard coding the explicit instructions. 
One of the foundational models in AI's evolution is machine learning \cite{jordan2015machine}, which includes techniques for classification, regression, and clustering \cite{huang2022large}. 
These methods allow computers to learn patterns and make predictions from data, forming the basis for many early AI applications. 
As the field matured, researchers developed more sophisticated models, including neural networks \cite{abiodun2018state}, which imitate the structure and function of the human brain to perform complex pattern recognition tasks \cite{schmidhuber2015deep}.

The evolution of AI is marked by significant milestones, particularly with the advent of deep learning \cite{lecun2015deep} techniques, which have revolutionized areas like computer vision \cite{voulodimos2018deep} and natural language processing (NLP) \cite{chowdhary2020natural}. 
Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, employs complex neural networks with multiple layers of processing units, enabling the extraction of high-level features from raw input data. 
It improved the performance of AI systems in tasks ranging from image and speech recognition to language translation \cite{goodfellow2016deep}.
Recent years some specialized architectures have further pushed the boundaries of what AI can achieve. 
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), \cite{rezende2014stochastic, kingma2013auto}, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)~\cite{goodfellow2014generative, vondrick2016generating, tulyakov2018mocogan, clark2019adversarial, brooks2022generating}, and diffusion models \cite{rombach2022high, ho2022imagen, blattmann2023align, gupta2023photorealistic} represent the forefront of AI research in data generation. 
GANs consist of two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—competing against each other to generate new, synthetic instances of data that are indistinguishable from real data. 
This has proven especially powerful in the fields of vision and sound generation, enabling the creation of photorealistic images, videos, and lifelike synthetic audio \cite{granot2022drop}.

The advancements in AI have not only expanded the horizons of what is technically feasible but have also paved the way for innovations in digital content creation that were previously unimaginable. 
The development and application of StyleGAN \cite{karras2019style} and its successors have been pivotal in pushing the limits of image generation technologies. 
These models have the remarkable ability to produce images of astonishing realism, manipulate facial expressions with precision, and even venture into the realm of digital art creation \cite{patashnik2021styleclip}. 
Similarly, the advent of diffusion models marks a significant leap in the quality of generated content, setting unprecedented standards for both image and sound generation \cite{rombach2022high}. 
These models operate by iteratively refining data inputs through a process that progressively reduces noise, allowing for the creation of outputs that are not only highly detailed but also deeply resonant with the nuances of real-world sensory experiences. 
Such advancements underscore the multifaceted impact of AI in the digital domain, where the synergy between complex neural networks and deep learning techniques is not just enhancing the visual and auditory quality of synthetic media but is also broadening the scope of creative expression and immersion in virtual environments. 
This ongoing evolution in AI-driven content generation reflects a convergence of insights from across computer science, mathematics, and neuroscience, highlighting the interdisciplinary effort that underpins AI's capability to reinterpret and reimagine the way machines understand and interact with the world around us \cite{silver2016mastering}.

\section{Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)}

In the field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), platforms like ChatGPT \cite{leiter2023chatgpt} \cite{openai2023gpt}, MidJourney \cite{MidjourneyExplore}, Runway \cite{runwayml}, and ElevenLabs \cite{elevenlabs} are redefining the boundaries of creative expression. 
ChatGPT, with its sophisticated large language model, excels in generating text that mocks human-like understanding and creativity, making it a helpful tool for crafting compelling narratives, dialogues, and even complex literary works. 
Its ability to process and produce coherent, contextually relevant content on a vast array of topics has democratized content creation, enabling writers and creators to generate high-quality text-based content efficiently. 
Similarly, MidJourney revolutionizes the visual aspect of content creation by transforming textual descriptions into detailed, high-resolution images, and also style transformation.
This AI-driven approach to art and design allows creators to visualize abstract concepts and bring their most imaginative ideas to life, significantly simplifying the visual image storytelling process. 
Runway offers a toolkit of video generation and editing powered by AI, enabling creators to automate labor-intensive tasks such as object detection, background removal, and even generating video clips from textual prompts. 
This not only streamlines the video production process but also opens up new avenues for creativity and experimentation in visual content. 
ElevenLabs, with its state-of-the-art voice synthesis technology, provides solutions for text to speech and speech to text, changing the language of a speech, and even cloning the voice.
Whether for dubbing, voiceovers, or virtual assistants, ElevenLabs offers unparalleled customization, allowing for the creation of unique vocal identities that can speak in multiple languages and tones. 
The combination of these AI models—ChatGPT, MidJourney, Runway, and ElevenLabs prelude a new age in digital content creation, where the fusion of text, image, video, and voice generated through AI not only enriches the content landscape but also offers creators the tools to craft experiences that were once unimaginable.

However, AIGC technology has also sparked ethical debates concerning the creation and use of AI-generated content. 
Deepfakes \cite{westerlund2019emergence}, which involve altering videos and images to the point of being indistinguishable from authentic media, have the potential to distort reality and spread misinformation. 
The manipulation of media content raises concerns about the impact on individuals' reputations and the broader implications for societal and political discourse. 
As artificial intelligence capabilities grow, the need for ethical guidelines that ensure transparency and prevent biases becomes more urgent.
Coupled with the ethical concerns surrounding deepfakes is the issue of copyright in AI-generated images and videos. \cite{hristov2016artificial}
The legal system is currently unprepared to tackle questions of ownership and violation when content is created by an AI. 
This prompts a discussion about the originality of AI-generated works and the ethical use of AI in creative processes. 
As AI becomes more pervasive, it will challenge traditional copyright laws, necessitating continuous research and the development of legal measures that keep pace with AI evolution.


\section{Current Development Trends}

The evolution of generative AI has unfolded with unexpected speed.
The transition from large, centralized systems to more accessible and powerful technologies has seen generative AI quickly reach a phase where enthusiasts and professionals can experiment and innovate with considerable autonomy. 
The proliferation of smaller, more efficient foundation models, such as Meta's LLaMa family \cite{touvron2023llama}, StableLM \cite{StabilityAI_StableLM}, and Mistral \cite{jiang2023mistral}, indicate a move towards greater performance with reduced resource requirements. 
These applications, alongside the increasing availability of open-source models, are democratizing AI by enabling a wider array of users to access state-of-the-art capabilities, fostering a more inclusive AI ecosystem.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{timeline.png}
  \caption{A comprehensive overview of key milestones and product launches in the generative AI video domain throughout the year 2023, with a notable concentration of developments occurring in the fourth quarter. \cite{a16zAI2023}}
\end{figure}

As the demand for AI capabilities continues to surge, the AI industry faces practical challenges such as GPU shortages and rising cloud costs. 
This situation is pushing developers to innovate with hardware-efficient models and explore new deployment environments.
The ability to run smaller models locally on devices is particularly significant, offering privacy advantages and opening up possibilities for edge computing and IoT applications. 
The ability to customize and fine-tune AI models is becoming increasingly important for businesses looking to differentiate their services. 
Open-source models offer the flexibility to develop tailored AI solutions, trained on proprietary data and optimized for specific industry needs. 
This approach is particularly relevant in sectors like healthcare, legal, and finance, which require specialized knowledge and expertise to generate high-quality content.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{products.png}
  \caption{Comparative analysis of various AI video product offerings as of December 2023, detailing generation types, maximum length of generated clips, and additional features such as camera and motion control, showcasing the diversity and capabilities within the current market landscape.\cite{a16zAI2023}}
\end{figure}

The regulatory environment for AI is rapidly evolving, with significant developments in the EU, China, and the US. 
The EU's provisional agreement on the AI Act \cite{eu_ai_act_2023}, China's measures to regulate AI usage \cite{China_AI_Policy_2023}, and the US's executive order on AI governance \cite{WhiteHouse_AI_ExecOrder_2023} reflect a global movement towards establishing legal frameworks to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. 
The outcome of ongoing legal battles, such as the New York Times' lawsuit against OpenAI \cite{Grynbaum_Mac_2023_Times_Sues_OpenAI}, may have far-reaching implications for the future of AI regulation and its impact on innovation and deployment. 
As we look towards the future, the most impactful developments in AI may well be centered around governance, middleware, and data pipelines that make generative AI more trustworthy and accessible. 
With a more refined understanding of AI capabilities, businesses are now focusing on integrating AI tools into existing services to enhance rather than revolutionize established processes. 
The challenge lies in striking a balance between leveraging the unique opportunities presented by AI while managing realistic expectations about its role in reshaping business practices.

\end{figure}

In the field of image generation, models like MidJourney, DALL-E 3, and Stable Diffusion 3 have been at the forefront. 
Video generation has also seen substantial growth, with platforms such as Runway Gen-2, Pika, and Sora pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in AI-generated cinematography. 
In the audio domain, AI's capability to replicate and generate human-like speech has made significant strides with models such as ElevenLabs, Speechify, and Whisper. 
These tools have not only democratized voice-over and audio content production but have also raised the bar for what can be expected from synthetic speech in terms of clarity, emotion, and expressiveness. 
The geographical landscape of AI development is also noteworthy, with the United States and China emerging as the primary incubators of AI innovation. 
Leading internet companies in these countries, including tech giants like Google, Meta, Alibaba, and ByteDance, have been instrumental in driving forward the development of AI technologies. 
Their investments have resulted in state-of-the-art models that, while most of them are not open-source.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)}

GPT-4 model emphasizes using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \cite{christiano2017deep} to align the model's outputs with human preferences. 

The objective of RLHF is to optimize the policy $\pi$ to maximize the expected reward, which is indicative of the alignment between generated outputs and human preferences:

\begin{equation}
\max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi} [R(\tau)]
\end{equation}

where $\tau = (s_0, a_0, ..., s_{T-1}, a_{T-1}, s_T)$ represents a trajectory of states and actions, and $R(\tau)$ is the cumulative reward for trajectory $\tau$.

Human feedback is used to train a reward model $R_{\theta}(s,a)$, parameterized by $\theta$, which estimates the reward of taking action $a$ in state $s$:

\begin{equation}
R_{\theta}(s,a) = \text{HumanFeedback}(s, a)
\end{equation}

The policy $\pi_{\phi}$, parameterized by $\phi$, is optimized using the reward model as a surrogate for the true human feedback:

\begin{equation}
\phi^{*} = \arg\max_{\phi} \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_{\phi}} [R_{\theta}(s,a)]
\end{equation}

Typically, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or a similar algorithm is employed for policy optimization, ensuring stable and efficient learning:

\begin{equation}
L(\phi) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t \left[ \min(r_t(\phi) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\phi), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t) \right]
\end{equation}

where $r_t(\phi) = \frac{\pi_{\phi}(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\phi_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$ is the probability ratio, $\hat{A}_t$ is the advantage estimate at time $t$, and $\epsilon$ is a hyperparameter that controls clipping to reduce variance.

All the processes above indicate how RLHF is mathematically conceptualized in the context of improving GPT models, focusing on optimizing a policy model to generate text that aligns with human preferences based on feedback.

\subsection{Transfer Learning}
Given a pretrained model \(M\) with parameters \(\theta\), transfer learning \cite{torrey2010transfer} adjusts \(\theta\) to new parameters \(\theta'\) to better perform on a target task \(T\) with a smaller dataset \(D_{T}\). The objective is to minimize the loss function \(\mathcal{L}_{T}\) on \(D_{T}\), leveraging knowledge from the source task \(S\).

The optimization problem can be formalized as:
\[
\theta' = \arg\min_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{T}(f_{\theta}(D_{T})),
\]
where \(f_{\theta}\) denotes the model's prediction function parameterized by \(\theta\).

The loss function \(\mathcal{L}_{T}\) often takes the form of cross-entropy in text-based tasks:
\[
\mathcal{L}_{T} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{ic}\log(p_{ic}),
\]
where \(N\) is the number of samples in \(D_{T}\), \(C\) is the number of classes, \(y_{ic}\) is a binary indicator of whether class \(c\) is the correct classification for observation \(i\), and \(p_{ic}\) is the predicted probability of observation \(i\) being in class \(c\).

For fine-tuning, we update \(\theta\) with a learning rate \(\alpha\) specific to the target task:
\[
\theta' = \theta - \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{T}(f_{\theta}(D_{T})).
\]

To prevent catastrophic forgetting, a regularization term \(\mathcal{R}(\theta)\) may be added, balancing the new task learning and retention of previously learned knowledge:
\[
\theta' = \arg\min_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{T}(f_{\theta}(D_{T})) + \lambda \mathcal{R}(\theta),
\]
where \(\lambda\) controls the importance of the regularization term, and \(\mathcal{R}(\theta)\) can be defined as the difference between the new parameters \(\theta'\) and the original pretrained parameters \(\theta\), such as in elastic weight consolidation (EWC):
\[
\mathcal{R}(\theta) = \sum_{i} \frac{1}{2} \Omega_{i} (\theta_{i} - \theta_{i}^{*})^2,
\]
with \(\Omega_{i}\) representing the importance of parameter \(i\) for the tasks learned during pretraining and \(\theta^{*}\) denoting the parameters after pretraining.


\section{AIGC in Image and Video}

\subsection{Variational Autoencoders (VAE)}

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a subclass of autoencoders that are foundational for generative models. They are composed of an encoder and a decoder \cite{cho2014properties}. The encoder transforms input data into a latent space, whereas the decoder reconstructs the input data from this space. The latent space is typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution, with the encoder providing the parameters—mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$—for this distribution.

The encoder part of a VAE is responsible for compressing the input data into a latent representation. For a given data element $x_i$, the encoder produces a mean $\mu_i$ and a variance $\sigma^2_i$ that define a Gaussian distribution in the latent space. The encoding process can be represented by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\log q_{\phi} \left( z^{(i)} | x^{(i)} \right) = \log \mathcal{N} \left( z^{(i)}; \mu^{(i)}, \sigma^{2(i)} I \right).
\end{equation}

To allow for gradient descent methods to work, VAEs employ a reparameterization trick. This trick involves sampling a noise vector $\epsilon$ from a standard Gaussian distribution and then constructing the latent vector $z_i$ by scaling the noise with the standard deviation and shifting by the mean:
\begin{equation}
z_i = \mu_i + \epsilon \times \sigma_i,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.

The decoder's goal is to reconstruct the input data from the latent representation. It tries to generate data that is as close as possible to the original input by maximizing the likelihood of the data given the latent space representation.

The training of VAEs involves maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the marginal likelihood of the observed data. The ELBO can be represented as follows:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_b = -D_{KL}(q(z|x)||p(z)) + \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L}(\log P(x|z)).
\end{equation}
Furthermore, the ELBO can be decomposed into two terms: the first being the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the encoder's distribution and the prior distribution of the latent variables, and the second term being the expected log-likelihood of the data given the latent variables. For a latent space with dimensionality $d$, and assuming a standard Gaussian prior, the loss function simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\theta, x^i) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d} \left( \mu^{2}_{(i)} + \sigma^{2}_{(i)} - \log \sigma^{2}_{(i)} - 1 \right) + \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \left( \log P(x^{i} | z) \right).
\end{equation}

Despite their advantages for generative tasks, VAEs have limitations, particularly for image generation. Directly sampling from the Gaussian distribution often results in blurred images. Moreover, there is an information loss when projecting the data to a lower-dimensional latent space, which affects the quality of the reconstruction. However, VAEs find extensive applications in feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, and they can be particularly effective when combined with other generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or diffusion models.

\subsection{Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)}

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represent a class of generative models that has significantly impacted the field of synthetic image generation. A GAN is composed of two distinct neural network models: a \textit{generator} ($G$) and a \textit{discriminator} ($D$). The generator attempts to produce data that is indistinguishable from genuine data, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the data, distinguishing between actual and generated samples.

The objective function of a GAN is formulated as a min-max game between $G$ and $D$:
\begin{align}
\min_{G} \max_{D} V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_{z}(z)}[\log (1 - D(G(z)))],
\end{align}
where $p_{data}$ is the data distribution, $x$ represents real data, $z$ is a noise sample from distribution $p_z$, and $G(z)$ is the generated data.

During training, $D$ is optimized to maximize the probability of correctly classifying a sample as real or fake. Simultaneously, $G$ is optimized to minimize $\log(1 - D(G(z)))$. In practice, this is often achieved by alternating between the following gradient ascent step for $D$:
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\theta_d} \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \Big[ \log D(x^{(i)}) + \log (1 - D(G(z^{(i)}))) \Big],
\end{align}
and the gradient descent step for $G$:
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\theta_g} \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log (1 - D(G(z^{(i)}))),
\end{align}
for a minibatch of $m$ samples.

GANs have been utilized to generate high-fidelity images, outperforming other generative models in visual quality. However, they often struggle with mode collapse -- a phenomenon where the generator produces a limited variety of outputs. Despite these challenges, GANs have shown impressive results in tasks beyond image generation, such as image super-resolution \cite{denton2015deep}and object detection \cite{goodfellow2014generative}.

\subsection{Diffusion Models}

Diffusion models \cite{sohl2015deep, ho2020denoising} are a class of generative models famous for their ability to generate high-quality images through a process that iteratively adds and removes noise. These models are characterized by their use of a Markov chain to gradually convert simple noise distributions into complex data distributions.

A diffusion model typically consists of two main components: the forward process (described in Algorithm 1) and the reverse process (described in Algorithm 2). The forward process models the gradual addition of noise to the data, while the reverse process models the generation of data from noise. Mathematically, the forward process can be described by:
\begin{equation}
q(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} \mathbf{x}_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I}),
\end{equation}
where $\beta_t$ is a variance schedule over discrete timesteps $t = 1, 2, ..., T$. 

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Diffusion model training \cite{bie2023renaissance}}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE for every training iteration do
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Sample $t$ from discrete timestep $1, 2, \ldots, T$, or from continuous timestep $t \sim [0, 1]$.
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Sample random noise $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Calculate $x_t$ based on DDPM forward or SDE forward.
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Update the model with noise prediction $\epsilon(x_t, t)$ or score function $s(x_t, t)$.
\STATE end for
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:diffusion_model_training}
\end{algorithm}

The reverse process involves learning a model to reverse this noise addition:
\begin{equation}
p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \mu_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \Sigma_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_t, t)),
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_t, t)$ and $\Sigma_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_t, t)$ are functions parameterized by a neural network.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Diffusion model Inference \cite{bie2023renaissance}}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Sample $x_t$ from normal Gaussian distribution $x_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$.
\STATE Sample discrete timesteps from $1, 2, \ldots, T$ or continuous timestep from $[0,1]$.
\STATE for $t$ in Reverse(timesteps) do
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Calculate the noise distribution $\epsilon(x_t, t)$ or score function $s(x_t, t)$ with the corresponding diffusion model.
\STATE \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Approximate $x_{t-1}$ or $x_{t-\Delta t}$ based on the reverse function.
\STATE end for
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:diffusion_model_inference}
\end{algorithm}

The training of diffusion models, as outlined in Algorithm 1, involves adjusting the parameters of the neural network to maximize the likelihood of the data under the reverse process. Similarly, the inference procedure, as outlined in Algorithm 2, utilizes the trained model to generate new data samples by reversing the noise process.

Diffusion models have been applied to a variety of tasks beyond image generation, such as super-resolution and inpainting, demonstrating their versatility and potential in numerous domains of generative modeling.

\subsection{Mitigating Biases in Generative Systems}

The development of generative text-to-image models has brought forth the challenge of mitigating social biases that these models may perpetuate. 
Notably, biases towards certain genders or skin tones have been observed in the outcomes of these image generation models. 
To offset this, a novel approach has been proposed \cite{esposito2023mitigating}, which involves fine-tuning text-to-image models on synthetic data constructed from diverse text prompts. 
These prompts include a variety of perceived skin tones, genders, ethnicities, professions, and age groups, resulting in a more inclusive synthetic dataset. 
Fine-tuning models with this diverse data has shown to substantially improve group fairness metrics, reducing biases by significant margins.
The process begins with the construction of text prompts through multiplicative combinations of various social qualifiers, which are then used to synthesize images that showcase a broad spectrum of human diversity. 
This method has proven to be effective, with diversity-finetuned models not only generating content that is more representative of darker skin tones and female genders but also improving overall fairness in model outcomes.

Furthermore, the evaluation of biases in text-to-image models is formulated within a group fairness framework, which assesses whether model outputs unfairly favor certain subgroups over others. 
By adopting this framework, the research moves beyond merely measuring bias to actively promoting fairness in AI-generated content. 
This is complemented by user studies that validate the absence of undesirable visual artifacts in finetuned models' outputs.
This approach not only showcases the capability to generate more inclusive content but also highlights the potential for AI to serve as a tool for social change. 
By actively mitigating biases, AI models can foster digital environments that are reflective of a wide spectrum of human experiences and perspectives, thereby promoting inclusivity and diversity.
Future work need to address additional forms of biases and explore the applicability of mitigative strategies in video models, thereby extending the principles of fairness and inclusivity to broader multimedia contexts.

\subsection{Computational Efficiency and Resolution Enhancement in Visual Processing}

In the rapidly evolving domain of image and video processing, implementations such as Skip-Convolutions \cite{habibian2021skip} have significantly improved computational efficiency, enabling high-quality visual outputs without compromising on speed or fidelity. 
These innovative methods bypass traditional linear processing pathways, allowing for selective data transmission across layers, thereby reducing the computational load while preserving or even enhancing the quality of video content. 
This technique proves especially beneficial for tasks that demand real-time processing, including live streaming, augmented reality (AR) applications, and instant video communication platforms, by accelerating video editing and enhancement operations. 
Furthermore, enhancing the resolution of images and videos has become increasingly crucial, with technologies like AI-based upscaling playing a pivotal role. 
AI upscaling techniques intelligently increase the resolution of digital media, ensuring that even content produced at lower resolutions can meet the current standards expected by consumers, without the need for extensive computational resources. \cite{ignatov2021real}
By integrating such approaches, Skip-Convolutions, along with AI upscaling, address the growing demand for premium video content that can be swiftly produced, edited, and shared, marking a shift towards more efficient content creation paradigms. 
Consequently, these advancements not only elevate the technical capabilities of video processing software but also substantially contribute to the broader field of digital media, where speed, efficiency, and enhanced resolution are extremely important. 
This progress highlights the ongoing necessity for innovation in computational methodologies to navigate the challenges presented by the increasing demand for multiple video content across various digital platforms.


\section{AIGC in Sound}

\subsection{Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)}

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) \cite{srivastava2015unsupervised, chiappa2017recurrent, ha2018world} have shown remarkable capabilities in modeling sequential data, making them particularly suited for applications in sound synthesis. 
Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs incorporate a feedback loop, allowing them to maintain a form of memory over input sequences. 
This characteristic is leveraged in sound synthesis to model the temporal dependencies of audio signals, enabling the generation of coherent and dynamic sound sequences.

The fundamental equation governing the operation of a basic RNN unit for sound synthesis can be described as follows:
\begin{equation}
h_t = \sigma(W_{ih} x_t + W_{hh} h_{t-1} + b_h)
\end{equation}
where $h_t$ represents the hidden state at time $t$, $x_t$ is the input vector at time $t$, $W_{ih}$ and $W_{hh}$ are the weights of the input-to-hidden and hidden-to-hidden connections, respectively, $b_h$ is the bias, and $\sigma$ denotes the activation function, often a non-linear function such as the tanh or ReLU.

The output of the RNN, which corresponds to the synthesized sound at each timestep, is computed as:
\begin{equation}
y_t = W_{ho} h_t + b_o
\end{equation}
where $y_t$ is the output vector at time $t$, $W_{ho}$ represents the weights of the hidden-to-output connections, and $b_o$ is the output bias. \\
To enhance the model's capacity to handle long-term dependencies, which are prevalent in complex sound sequences, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) \cite{yu2019review} units or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) \cite{dey2017gate} can be incorporated. 
These advanced variants of RNNs introduce mechanisms such as forget gates (in LSTMs) and update gates (in GRUs) that allow the network to selectively remember or forget information. 
This capability significantly improves the network's ability to model sequences with long-range temporal dependencies, making it highly effective for tasks like sound synthesis where the coherence over time is crucial.

\subsection{Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)}

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units are a specific type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly in handling long-term dependencies. LSTMs are adept at modeling the temporal relationships inherent in complex sound sequences, making them highly effective for sound synthesis tasks. The LSTM's architecture includes several key components—forget gate, input gate, cell state, and output gate—that work together to regulate the flow of information through the unit. These components allow the LSTM to retain or discard information over long sequences, enabling the generation of coherent and dynamic audio content. The following equations provide a detailed mathematical representation of the LSTM's operation:

Forget Gate:
\begin{equation}
f_t = \sigma(W_{f} \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
\end{equation}
It decides which information from the cell state is to be discarded. $f_t$ represents the forget gate's activation at time $t$. $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $W_{f}$ is the weight matrix for the forget gate, $h_{t-1}$ is the previous hidden state, $x_t$ is the current input, and $b_f$ is the bias.

Input Gate:
\begin{equation}
i_t = \sigma(W_{i} \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_{C} \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
\end{equation}
It controls the extent to which new information is stored in the cell state. $i_t$ is the input gate's activation, and $\tilde{C}_t$ is the candidate value for addition to the cell state. $W_{i}$ and $W_{C}$ are the weight matrices, and $b_i$ and $b_C$ are biases.

Cell State Update:
\begin{equation}
C_t = f_t \ast C_{t-1} + i_t \ast \tilde{C}_t
\end{equation}
It is updated by removing information deemed unnecessary by the forget gate and adding new candidate values scaled by the input gate's activation.

Output Gate:
\begin{equation}
o_t = \sigma(W_{o} \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
h_t = o_t \ast \tanh(C_t)
\end{equation}
It determines the next hidden state $h_t$, which contains information about the current input and the previous state, to be passed to the network. The output gate's activation $o_t$ scales the tanh of the updated cell state, deciding the part of the cell state to output.

In sound synthesis applications, LSTM models are trained on large datasets of audio samples, allowing them to learn and generate new sound sequences that closely mimic the characteristics of the training data. The ability to model long-term dependencies makes LSTMs particularly suited for generating complex and temporally coherent sound sequences, such as musical compositions or natural speech patterns. By optimizing the LSTM parameters (weights and biases) through backpropagation, the model can be fine-tuned to produce high-quality audio outputs that capture the nuances of human-generated sounds.

\subsection{Autoregressive Transformers}

Autoregressive Transformers \cite{yan2021videogpt, wu2022nuwa} have improved sound synthesis by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to model complex sequential data. Unlike RNNs, Transformers process sequences in parallel, allowing for more efficient training and better handling of long-term dependencies. 
In sound synthesis, autoregressive Transformers predict subsequent audio samples based on a sequence of past samples, capturing the temporal dynamics of sound.
The core concept of the Transformer architecture in sound synthesis can be described by the following equations about the self-attention mechanism and the generation process:

Input Embedding and Positional Encoding:
\begin{equation}
X' = X + PE
\end{equation}
where $X$ is the input sequence of sound samples or features, and $PE$ is the positional encoding added to $X$ to retain positional information.

Self-Attention Mechanism:
\begin{equation}
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\end{equation}
where $Q$, $K$, and $V$ represent the queries, keys, and values matrices obtained from $X'$, respectively, and $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors. This equation calculates the attention weights and applies them to the values to produce an output that highlights important features of the input sequence.

Multi-Head Attention:
\begin{equation}
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h)W^O
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i)
\end{equation}
Multi-head attention allows the model to focus on different positions, capturing various aspects of the sound sequence. $W^Q_i$, $W^K_i$, $W^V_i$, and $W^O$ are parameter matrices for each head $i$ and the output projection, respectively.

Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks:
\begin{equation}
\text{FFN}(x) = \max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
\end{equation}
Each layer in the Transformer includes a feed-forward network applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

Output Generation:
\begin{equation}
P(y_t | y_{<t}) = \text{softmax}(y_{t-1}W + b)
\end{equation}
The output at each timestep $t$, $y_t$, is predicted based on the previous outputs $y_{<t}$, where $W$ and $b$ are the weights and bias in the final linear layer that projects the decoder output to the space of possible audio samples. $P(y_t | y_{<t})$ represents the probability distribution over possible next samples given the previous samples.

By training on sequences of audio samples, autoregressive Transformers learn to generate new sound sequences sample by sample, offering a powerful framework for high-quality sound synthesis, including music composition and speech generation, with the ability to capture the long-range dependencies characteristic of audio signals.

\subsection{Voice Cloning \& Text-to-Speech (TTS)}

The applications of AI-driven voice synthesis, particularly through voice cloning and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies like ElevenLabs \cite{elevenlabs} and Whisper \cite{OpenAIWhisper}, has apparently closed the gap between synthetic and human speech. 
These systems utilize deep learning frameworks to analyze and replicate the nuances of human speech, including tonality and emotion. 
Voice cloning involves creating a digital replica of a target voice from a limited set of audio samples. 
The process can be described by the following stages:

Feature Extraction:
\begin{equation}
F = \text{MFCC}(S)
\end{equation}
where $F$ represents the feature matrix extracted from the input speech signal $S$, and MFCC denotes the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, a common feature used in voice synthesis to capture the timbral aspects of the speech.

Acoustic Modeling:
\begin{equation}
H = \text{Encoder}(F; \theta_e)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tilde{F} = \text{Decoder}(H; \theta_d)
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the encoded representation of the speech features, $\theta_e$ and $\theta_d$ are the parameters of the encoder and decoder networks, respectively, and $\tilde{F}$ is the reconstructed feature matrix. The encoder-decoder framework is often implemented using deep neural networks, where the encoder learns a compressed representation of the speech features, and the decoder reconstructs the features, potentially in the target voice's style.

Voice Conversion:
\begin{equation}
V_t = \text{Conversion}(H_t; \theta_c)
\end{equation}
where $V_t$ represents the target voice features, $H_t$ is the encoded representation of the target speech, and $\theta_c$ are the parameters of the conversion model that transforms the source voice into the target voice.

Waveform Generation:
\begin{equation}
\hat{S} = \text{WaveNet}(V_t; \theta_w)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{S}$ is the synthesized speech waveform, and $\theta_w$ are the parameters of a WaveNet \cite{oord2016wavenet} model trained to convert the feature representation $V_t$ back into the time-domain signal. WaveNet, a deep generative model of raw audio waveforms, is particularly effective in generating high-fidelity speech with natural intonations and expressions.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{whisper.png}
  \caption{Autoregressive transformer model architecture used for audio processing tasks like transcription and voice synthesis. The model utilizes a stack of encoder and decoder blocks, with sinusoidal positional encodings and learned positional encodings for sequence representation. \cite{OpenAIWhisper}}
\end{figure}

The process of voice cloning and modification enables the generation of synthetic speech that closely resembles a target human voice. 
By capturing the subtle nuances of speech, AI-driven voice synthesis technologies have opened new avenues for creating engaging and emotionally resonant digital communication experiences. 

\subsection{Audio Modification}

There are several methods to tackle audio modification challenges such as noise reduction, sound separation, and audio restoration \cite{godsill2002digital}. 
The processes are shown below:

Noise reduction aims to eliminate unwanted background noise from audio recordings, enhancing the clarity of the sound. This can be mathematically represented by:
\begin{equation}
S_{clean} = S_{noisy} - N
\end{equation}
where $S_{clean}$ is the clean audio signal, $S_{noisy}$ is the original noisy signal, and $N$ represents the noise component. Advanced AI models, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), are trained to estimate $N$ accurately from $S_{noisy}$, allowing for effective noise removal.

Sound separation involves isolating individual sound sources from a mixed audio signal. This can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
S_i = F(S_{mix}; \theta_i)
\end{equation}
where $S_i$ is the isolated sound of source $i$, $S_{mix}$ is the mixed audio signal, and $F$ is a function modeled by the AI system with parameters $\theta_i$ tailored to extract the $i^{th}$ sound source.

Audio restoration focuses on recovering the original quality of degraded audio recordings. The process can be conceptualized as:
\begin{equation}
S_{restored} = R(S_{degraded}; \theta_r)
\end{equation}
where $S_{restored}$ is the restored audio signal, $S_{degraded}$ is the degraded audio signal, and $R$ represents the restoration function implemented by the AI with parameters $\theta_r$. This function aims to reconstruct lost or corrupted signal components, effectively restoring the audio to its original state.

The final step often involves enhancing the waveform directly to improve the overall audio quality, which can be mathematically described by:
\begin{equation}
\hat{S} = G(S_{processed}; \theta_g)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{S}$ is the enhanced audio waveform, $S_{processed}$ is the audio signal after noise reduction, sound separation, and restoration, and $G$ is the enhancement function driven by AI with parameters $\theta_g$. Models like WaveNet are examples of generative networks that can be used for this purpose, fine-tuning the audio quality by adjusting the waveform directly.

These core processes involved in audio modification, demonstrating how AI algorithms can significantly improve the clarity, fidelity, and overall quality of sound recordings.
