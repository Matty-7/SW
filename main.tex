% Abstract in English

\instructions{This study delves into the transformative realm of AI-driven generative technologies, 
examining their development and deployment in image and video synthesis. 
Through a comparative analysis of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), 
Diffusion Models, and Neural Cellular Automata, the research investigates their underlying theoretical frameworks and experimental applications. 
Key findings reveal nuanced insights into the algorithms' efficacy in generating photorealistic outputs and their potential in various industries. 
The research also critically assesses the ethical landscape, underscoring the importance of safety and fairness in AI-generated content. 
Major conclusions suggest a trajectory towards more autonomous and creative AI systems, while advocating for robust ethical guidelines to govern their use. 
This abstract, a synthesis of the comprehensive document, ensures a precise overview of the research's scope and its major contributions to the field of AI and generative media.}

\instructions{Individuals and organizations who helped with the research project
and provided financing are thanked in a paragraph of the thesis. Do not
include individual titles in the acknowledgments. However, it is
appropriate to state grant numbers and sponsors. Examples would like
SELF, SRS, SW Grants, etc.}

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\instructions{This section includes a clear statement of the problem and the
reasons for studying it.~Provide a detailed yet concise background
discussion of the problem and the significance, scope, and limits of the
work. Outline what has been done previously by citing truly pertinent
literature but do not include a general survey of semi-relevant
literature.~ State how your work differs from earlier work in the field
and demonstrate the continuity from the previous work to your own.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Material and Methods}
\label{material-and-methods}

\instructions{This section is obviously discipline specific so use the
nomenclature that is common for your discipline. However, this section
should provide sufficient detail about the materials and the methods
used so that other experienced workers can repeat the experiment and
obtain comparable results. Cite the appropriate literature when using a
standard method or protocol and give only the details needed. Identify
the materials used in the research. For example, computer systems used,
mathematical theorems exploited, etc.; give information on the purity of
all chemicals and reagents employed in the research; include the
chemical/biological names of all compounds and chemical formulas of
substances that are new or uncommon. Use standard systematic
nomenclature to unambiguously define well-established compounds,
processes, equipment, etc.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Results}
\label{results}

\instructions{Summarize the data collected in this section, and their
statistical treatment. Include only relevant data, but give sufficient
detail to justify the conclusions. It is appropriate in this section to
use equations, figures, and tables to display your data. Extensive, but
relevant data, should be reserved for an appendix where it is identified
as supporting information.}

\instructions{The table or figure must follow as closely as possible after the
paragraph in which it is referenced. Titles/captions should be kept
brief.}

\section{Examples}

Here is some inline math, $x^2 > 1$, and some display math
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx
\end{equation}
And this is how to cite an article \cite{Zhang2021} or a book \cite{Axler2020}.

\chapter{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

\instructions{The discussion section is where you interpret and compare the
results. The objective is to point out the features and limitations of
the work. Relate your results to current knowledge in the field and to
the original purpose for undertaking the project.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

\instructions{This section is written to put the interpretation of the results
into the context of the original problem.~ Do not repeat the discussion
points or include irrelevant material. The conclusion should be based on
the evidence presented.}
